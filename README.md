# Book-Recommendation-System

Book recommendation using collaberative filtering

1. Introduction :
This project is to help we discover new books we&#39;ll love. We&#39;ve built a smart system that
suggests books based on what we&#39;ve enjoyed before. By analyzing how people rate
and read books, our system finds patterns to recommend similar ones.
we can tell us about a book we liked, and we&#39;ll suggest others that we might enjoy.
Our system uses clever tricks to match books we might not have discovered on wer
own. We&#39;ve sorted through lots of data about books and how people like them to
make our suggestions as accurate as possible.the project is all about making it easier for we to find wer next favorite book.
Whether it&#39;s mystery, romance, or sci-fi, we&#39;re here to help we explore new
adventures in the world of books!
